Where the Mariposa branch of IS4C has diverged from the 'gohanman' branch:

fannie:
* departments and subdepartments in sample data were changed
* fannie code to update UNFI prices was changed to use the Custom SRP
* added new table 'accounts' to hold unique accounts, their names, balances, discounts, and max balances
* mysql trigger used on insert into dtransactions to update accounts balance
* added MESS/ directory and php script which takes transactions from MESS over http 

is4c-nf:
* added cron directory and script to sync custdata and accounts to the lane itself
* changed member search to search the name field in the accounts table rather than CardNo or first/last name
* add 'MB' tender type which basically allows for no payment if the account balance can accomodate it
* add 'CB' tender type which is almost the same as CA except that it does not give any change, allowing the remainder to float to the account balance
