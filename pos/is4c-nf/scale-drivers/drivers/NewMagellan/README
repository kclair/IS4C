COMPILATION

1. Windows
	Compilation on Windows requires
	* .NET 2.0 Runtime
	* .NET 2.0 SDK
	The latter provides a special command line
	with all the appropriate environment variables
	set. Use that (or set them yourself) then
	run make.bat
2. Non-windows
	Requires mono.
	Use the makefile.

DESIGN NOTES

Originally, this was similar to the original, VB magellan
and used a WebBrowser object embedded in a windows form with
various page change callbacks registered. Turns out WebBrowser
objects are flaky at best on the Linux/mono side of things, so
there's been some significant refactoring to remove the GUI 
portions. Some naming conventions seem odd now that made sense
in the original structure (e.g., DelegateForm is no longer a
System.Windows.Forms.Form, nor does it contain any delegates).
